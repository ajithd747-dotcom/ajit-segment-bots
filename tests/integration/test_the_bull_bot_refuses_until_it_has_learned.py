"""Eleven processes, real trades, and a bot that correctly says nothing yet.

The bull bot's whole chain runs here: filter, features, outlier rejection,
conviction, calibration, entry timing, exit planning and composition, with the
scanner in front of it and `signal-outcome-labeller` beside it. What comes out at
the far end, at first, is **nothing** — and that is the assertion.

An untrained model forms no conviction; without a conviction there is no timing and
no exit plan; without those the composer refuses. Every one of those refusals is
correct, and the reason this test exists is that a chain which produces nothing
because it is thinking and a chain which produces nothing because it is broken look
identical from outside. So this pins the difference: the parts before the model
produce, the model refuses, and the labeller is accumulating what will eventually
change that.

The trades are real (RL-063). They are replayed rather than live because a test
that needed a venue would fail when a venue had an outage rather than when this code
was wrong; the run itself is live (RL-071).
