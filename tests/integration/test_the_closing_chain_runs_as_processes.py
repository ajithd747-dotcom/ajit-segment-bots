"""Nine processes, a paper fill, and a position that closes across the bus.

`test_a_paper_position_opens_and_closes` proves the decisions are right by wiring
the engines together in one process. This proves the **wiring** is right: the same
chain, each part forked by the launcher exactly as the live spine forks it, every
message crossing a real process boundary, and nothing reaching across.

It exists because the failure it catches is invisible to the other test. Ten parts
had correct code and no `start_part`, and each `start_part` binds a part's inputs by
the types it declares -- a binding that reads the wrong field, unpacks a payload the
wrong way, or publishes a shape the next part cannot read produces silence, and
silence looks exactly like a market that has not moved.

**The prices are today's tape** (RL-063), replayed here rather than taken live so
that a venue outage fails as a venue outage rather than as this code being wrong.
The run being tested is the live one.

**The operator's own state is not touched.** The settings are copied and both the
journal and the learned-state directory are pointed at this run's own files: a test
that appended to the real ledger would put test decisions inside the record of what
the system actually decided.
