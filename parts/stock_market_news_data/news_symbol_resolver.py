"""news-symbol-resolver: resolve the instruments a news item names.

The blueprint says one thing about this part and it is the whole design: the
alias table is **built off `broker-instrument-listing`, never hardcoded**. A
handwritten map of "Larsen & Toubro" to `LT` is a file that is wrong the week NSE
lists something new and that nobody notices is wrong, because a name that fails
to resolve looks exactly like an item about nothing.

So the table is the broker's own master, re-derived from every restatement. Two
fields carry it, and both are needed:

    trading_symbol   RELIANCE          LT                    HINDPETRO
    name             RELIANCE          LARSEN & TOUBRO LTD.  HINDUSTAN PETROLEUM
                     INDUSTRIES LTD                          CORP

`name` was not on `InstrumentListing` until 2026-09-12 — the adapter read it from
Upstox's master and dropped it — and without it this part could not exist: no
amount of string work turns "Larsen & Toubro" into `LT`, and that is the second
most-mentioned name in the real capture.

## One rule: the normalised forms are equal, or the name does not resolve

A mention is normalised — upper case, punctuation to spaces, digits split from
letters, the company-form words (`LTD`, `CORP`, `THE`, `AND`) dropped — and must
match a normalised symbol or a normalised name **exactly**. That is the whole
rule, and it does the work: measured on real `haiku` output over two real stories
against the real 2,871-instrument master, 12 of 13 mentions resolved, including
every one that needed the name rather than the symbol.

    Larsen & Toubro       -> LT            State Bank of India -> SBIN
    Mahindra & Mahindra   -> M&M           Bajaj Finance       -> BAJFINANCE
    Reliance Industries   -> RELIANCE      Axis Bank           -> AXISBANK

**A looser rule was written first and measured worse.** "Every word of the
mention appears in the name" was meant to catch a shortening, and on real data it
caught nothing at all — the company-form words being dropped already handles
`HINDUSTAN PETROLEUM CORP` — while making `NIFTY50` match nine index variants
(`NIFTY50 VALUE 20`, `NIFTY50 SHARIAH`, ...) and so resolve to none of them. One
shared word is one shared word whether the rule says "prefix" or "subset". It was
deleted rather than tuned.

The one that does not resolve is the honest answer: **`HPCL`** appears nowhere
in the master, which writes `HINDPETRO` and `HINDUSTAN PETROLEUM CORP`. Nothing
derivable can bridge it, and the alias that would is the hardcoded table the
blueprint refuses. It lands in `names_not_resolved`. `SENSEX` and `NIFTY50` both
resolve, the second because splitting digits from letters is normalisation rather
than an alias.

`names_not_resolved` is the number that says whether this part is working: an
empty tagging with no explanation is indistinguishable from an item about nothing.

**Ambiguity is refused, not broken.** A mention matching more than one instrument
resolves to none of them and is counted: guessing between two companies in a
trading system is worse than saying the name was unclear.

## What it does not do

It does not read the item. The names come from `news-text-structurer`'s
`names_mentioned`, as the article wrote them; this part only decides which
instrument each one is. And it does not tag segments — an index and a share are
different markets, so `names_an_index` travels on the tagging and
`news-segment-classifier` routes on it.
