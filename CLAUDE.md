## THE CRYPTO SETTINGS ARE DONE — 2026-09-12

`python3 dashboard/measure_objectives.py` is the drift guard and **CLAUDE.md has
always said to run it before deciding what to work on.** It went unrun for
sessions while the number sat at 106/107; running it is the first thing now.

    settings fitted to crypto      81 -> 7   (3 measured, inconclusive)
    converted, provenance kept      9 -> 45
    inert, reader is off            0 -> 10
    needs an Indian mechanism       0 -> 8
    market-independent              0 -> 20
    learned checkpoints          5 of 7 -> 0 of 3
    parts/ files naming crypto        13 -> 4

**`operate/refit_settings_to_the_indian_market.py` holds every decision**, one
entry per setting with its derivation, and is idempotent. It parses its own
output with tomllib before writing and refuses otherwise -- added because a
provenance note took every part down once and nearly did twice.

Six states, and only the first is work outstanding. The others exist because
"nothing to do" has to be a stated answer or it reads as "nobody looked"
(Rule 8): **converted** (re-derived, note says what it was), **inert** (reader is
off the spine -- re-deriving for a decision nobody makes is inventing a figure),
**needs a mechanism** (a bought option pays theta not funding and cannot be
liquidated -- rescaling would be fiction that looks derived),
**market-independent** (a bus ceiling is a bus ceiling), and **measured but
inconclusive**, which stays counted as outstanding because recording an attempt
is not settling one.

The three numbers that were actively wrong, each measured on this project's own
tape for 2026-09-08:

| | was | now | why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `taker_fee_rate` | 0.00055 | 0.004266 | Bybit's taker fee charged on every Indian trade, **7.8x** understated, feeding position-sizer, 628,233 cost estimates and the tailgater's break-even |
| `risk_maximum_stop_fraction` | 0.05 | 0.33 | an NSE option's median session range is **12.89%**, so every stop sat inside ordinary noise |
| `feed_gap_threshold` | 60s | 150s | an Indian option prints **0.7 times a minute** against BTCUSDT's four a second; ordinary silence reaches 147.8s at p95 |

Correcting the fee made three neighbours wrong -- their notes said "anchored to
the taker fee" -- including `liquidity_deep_cost_fraction`, where the "deep"
grade became unreachable and every Indian symbol read thinner than it is. Expect
that shape: fixing one number here often breaks its neighbour.

The measurements are in `measurements/2026-09-12-indian-order-sizes/`,
`-indian-feed-cadence/`, `-indian-return-distribution/` and
`-indian-pair-behaviour/`.

**Since 2026-09-13 the guard reads 6, and all 6 are measured but inconclusive** --
none is unexamined. Three of the four measurements named here were made that day
(candle-boundary jumps, implied-vs-realised gap, drift by age;
`measurements/2026-09-13-indian-guard-remainder/`); the spread half-life on
time-spaced bars is still open, and it is what the three cointegration settings and
`spread_reversion_horizon` wait on. `feed_jump_threshold_fraction` is open for a
design reason, not a missing number: one floor cannot sit above ordinary contract
bar moves and below an index break. `docs/settings-fitted-to-crypto-the-guard-cannot-see.md`
is the ledger for the 34 the guard could not see.

**`symbol-price-frame` carries contracts and underlyings** (two producers:
broker-underlying-price-frame-bridge and price-level-sampler). A setting read off it
serves both; measure both, as distinct trades, before refitting one.

## SCOPE CHANGE — 2026-09-12, read before any segment work

**Two segments, not three.** The operator: *"Lets focus only on option index and
option stocks full universe and retire the intraday cash"*, then *"make sure
notin isard coded and detects auto maticly every tme"*.

| | |
|---|---|
| built segments | `index-options`, `stock-options` |
| retired | `cash-equity-intraday` — **settings-off, not removed**; its file and all its parts stay, bringing it back is one line in `built_segments` plus a restart |
| capital | ₹7,500,000 each (its ₹5,000,000 split between them); total unchanged at ₹1.5 crore |
| universe | **220 underlyings — 10 indices, 210 shares — 8 contracts each = 1,980 of the connection's 2,000 keys** |

**"Full universe" is of underlyings.** 36,178 option contracts exist against a
connection that accepts 2,000 keys and evicts nothing, so the contract universe
was never subscribable.

**Nothing is named by hand.** Both universes are rules read off the broker's own
master every restatement — `every-nse-index-with-an-option` and
`every-nse-stock-with-an-option`, the complement of the cash segment's existing
`every-nse-share-without-a-derivative`. An exchange listing options on a new
index, or NSE revising the F&O list, is picked up with no edit. The symbol lists
still in each segment file are **fallbacks**, not the universe. MCX is not
blacklisted — it excludes itself, because the index rule admits NSE_INDEX and
BSE_INDEX and MCXBULLDEX is MCX_INDEX.

`docs/proposals/two-option-segments-on-a-derived-universe.md` carries the
measurements. **One open question, and it is the operator's:**
`minimum_capital_per_trade` (₹100,000) over NSE's freeze quantity (1,755 for
NIFTY) imposes a **~₹57 floor on any index option premium** this segment can
trade — on the real 2026-09-08 tape it makes 4 of 8 contracts untradeable. The
two settings were each chosen without the other in view.

**Sizing is bounded by the venue now, not only by the desk**
(`docs/proposals/no-order-larger-than-the-exchange-accepts.md`). Seven NIFTY
trades on 2026-09-08 were 91.4% of every rupee this project has lost, and the
cause was mechanical: the capital ceiling was computed at the touch price and
converted into 2,000,000 units of a contract NSE caps at 1,755 per order, which
the paper book filled by walking the price 69.5%. `trade-capital-bounds-gate`
now snaps to whole lots on **every** path (not just bump and cap), caps at
`freeze_quantity` — which nothing in this project read until that day — never
refuses a close, and counts capital it has itself let through until a `position`
reports it, so orders cannot stack inside one millisecond.

**`label-builder`'s `THE_SIZE_WAS_RIGHT` could never be false**: `_stop_distance`
read a field `ClosedTradeRecord` never declared, so the `getattr` default made
every label assert the size was right. It is a declared field now and an unknown
stop omits the component rather than asserting it. Still open: nothing consumes
that component, no closed trade carries its stop, and the conviction models train
only on `signal-outcome-labeller` — so `label-builder` has built **zero** labels
ever.

## TEMPORARY GOAL (third, active) — 2026-09-06, read before anything else

**Take every one of the 373 parts individually and prove, with a real-data
test, that it is actually serving its purpose — or find that it is a skeleton
producing decoration.** The user's full statement is at the top of
`docs/goal.md`; the standard, in their words, is whether a part is *"really
providing or working with the data according to its intended purpose, or if it
is just a skeleton providing or inputting or outputing rubbish data which is not
useful just decorating data"*.

**This is not the second goal repeated.** That audit asked whether data
*flows*, measured from each part's own bus counters. This asks whether what
flows is **worth anything**. A part can be RUNNING, every wire can read
CARRYING, all four checkers can pass, and it can still publish a number that
means nothing — a climbing counter proves a message moved, never that it was
right. The first question cannot answer the second.

The user's own examples set the bar, and each names a different way to be
hollow:

| part kind | what to actually ask |
|---|---|
| news parts | is the output a real reading — NIFTY support/resistance an operator would recognise — or a filled-in shape? |
| prediction parts | does it work **for every open trade**, not for one fixture? |
| online research | is it producing **real useful data**, or decoration? |

**"Appropriate test with real data" is the user's phrase and RL-063 is the
standard.** A fixture is exactly what makes a hollow part look healthy, so a
verdict may rest only on the tape, the Upstox history, the free Yahoo/NSE
sources, or the real instrument master.

**Ledger: `docs/part-purpose-audit.md`.** One row per part — what it is for,
what was fed in, what came out, and the verdict: `SERVING ITS PURPOSE`,
`SKELETON`, or `NOT MEASURED`. Rule 8 binds it: a part nobody has tested reads
`NOT MEASURED`, never green, and never a bare pass. Read it before judging
anything and append to it, or every session re-judges what the last one did.

The user asked this stay active across every session until it is complete. It
does not replace either goal below; all three are active.

## TEMPORARY GOAL (second, active) — 2026-09-05, read before anything else

**A systematic audit of all 29 foundational features (`docs/features.json`
categories) one at a time, each covering every part inside it**: verify data is
actually flowing on every consumed and produced connection (measured, not
inferred from the declared contract); find every part still shaped like
crypto rather than Indian stocks and convert or replace it with the real
Indian-market equivalent, never just delete it; decide whether 29 foundational
features is enough or more are needed; decide whether any of the 29 is missing
a part it needs to do its job fully.

**The user asked this stay active across every session until it is achieved
completely** — it is not a one-session task, and multi-session persistence is
the point, not an afterthought. The full statement, in the user's own words, is
in `docs/goal.md`'s second TEMPORARY GOAL section (2026-09-05). It does not
replace the first temporary goal below; both are active.

**When the market is shut, replay real history — never a snapshot of a shut
market.** Standing instruction from the operator, 2026-09-06:

    python3 operate/replay_a_captured_session.py          # history by default when shut
    python3 operate/replay_a_captured_session.py --day 2026-09-04   # the tape instead

The tape is only a few days deep and holds only what the feed was subscribed to;
Upstox serves one-minute bars from **January 2022** for equities, indices and
every currently listed option, so there is always a real session to replay. The
replay asks `market-session-calendar` — the live spine's own answer — and an
unmeasured session counts as shut. A bar close is one price a minute rather than
every print, so the tape stays the finer evidence where it exists.

**Three free sources, so no replay depends on one broker's quota** (operator,
2026-09-06 — "you can find other free sources instead of relying only on
Upstox", then "find the options price source"):

| source | covers | granularity | depth | account |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `operate/historical_prints.py` (Upstox) | everything, options included | 1 minute | Jan 2022 | broker token, **daily quota** |
| `operate/yahoo_finance_prints.py` | equities, indices — **no options** | 1m / 5m / 1d | 1m ~1 month, 1d 10 years | none |
| `operate/nse_fo_bhavcopy.py` (NSE's own) | **every option and future** | daily OHLC + volume + OI | ~2 years | none |
| `operate/nse_intraday_option_prices.py` (NSE's own) | **every option, index and stock** | intraday ticks | **most recent session only** | none |
| Upstox `/v2/expired-instruments/...` (measured 2026-09-16) | **expired** index and stock options | 1 minute | NIFTY from 2024-10-03, stocks from 2024-10-31 | broker token; answered 200 on this account |

The ordinary history endpoint serves a *listed* option only since it listed -- at most 33 sessions, median 7, measured 2026-09-16 -- and answers HTTP 400 once it expires. Past option sessions come from the expired-instruments route (`measurements/2026-09-16-how-deep-option-history-goes/`).

`operate/historical_prints.prints_for_instrument` picks between them and says
which one served: equities and indices from Yahoo, options from NSE's intraday
chart, **Upstox only when neither can** — it is the one source with a quota and
the only one that can serve an arbitrary past option session, so spending it on
a price a free source would have given is spending the thing that cannot be
replaced. Verified 2026-09-06: a full three-segment replay of 2026-09-04 ran on
4 Yahoo and 4 NSE instruments and **made no Upstox call at all**.

NSE's intraday endpoint writes IST wall-clock as though it were an epoch —
09:15 IST arrives as 09:15 "UTC". Shifted back 5:30 it agrees with this
project's own tape to 0.30% tick-against-tick; read as UTC it disagrees by
3.88%. Same trap the project already carries for Upstox's historical rows.

Yahoo was checked against this project's own captured tape minute by minute and
agreed to a **median difference of 0.0000%** (MARUTI, NATIONALUM, BAJAJ-AUTO;
133/133/82 shared minutes). NSE's file carries 26,872 stock options and 4,996
index options for one session — complete coverage of both Phase A segments,
against the 2,000 instruments the live feed can subscribe to. It is daily, so it
is breadth and history where Upstox is intraday depth.

`nsearchives.nseindia.com` is **not** blocked — the earlier note was about a
different path, and it was the filename that was wrong. The legacy
`content/historical/DERIVATIVES/...` names answer 404; the UDiFF ones under
`content/fo/` are what NSE serves now.

**The Upstox historical quota is real and it is not per-second.** After a day of
fetching, Upstox answers HTTP 429 and keeps refusing through four backoffs
totalling 200 seconds. Fetched ranges are cached under
`~/.local/share/ajit-segment-bots/history/` because a past session never
changes — a replay of a given day is then free to repeat, which is what makes
history usable as the default rather than as a one-shot.

**Run `python3 dashboard/measure_objectives.py` before deciding what to work
on.** It states both temporary goals as measured numbers — whether any segment
bot has actually traded (`fills_applied` per paper account), how many of the 29
features are walked, how much of the diagram carries, and **how many files still
name a crypto venue**. That last number is a drift guard with a reason: on
2026-09-06 a session spent its effort working out which Binance symbols happened
to cointegrate, tuning a crypto test, when the standing instruction was to
replace it with the Indian-market equivalent. Nothing objected because nothing
was counting. It counts **code**, not comments — a file ported to Upstox keeps
a note saying what it was ported from, and that is history rather than drift;
counting both together gives a figure that never falls however much is
converted. Baseline 2026-09-06 after the first two integration tests were
ported: **107 files** (parts 14, runtime 1, tests 82, operate 1, dashboard 9);
**106** after `mean-reversion-detector`'s floor was re-derived. If that number is
not falling, the audit is not doing what it was asked to do.

**A second drift number was added 2026-09-06, and it is the sharper one: how
many *settings* are still fitted to crypto.** A file that mentions Binance is a
naming problem; a **number** whose provenance note justifies it by naming
Binance is a decision being made every tick on a market this project does not
trade. **83 of 922 settings**, **78 of them read by a running part**. That is
not hypothetical drift — `mean_reversion_minimum_volatility_fraction` was five
basis points because that was *"just under the round trip at the venues' taker
fees"*, and on NSE it refused **92.2% of every in-session NIFTY
observation** and let `mean-reversion-detector` raise **zero candidates**. Re-derived
from Indian data it is `0.000037`, and the same captured session then produced
**1,470**. Each of the remaining 78 is a number nobody has checked against the
market it now decides in.

**`docs/feature-audit.md` is the ledger this goal is walked with** — which of
the 29 has been walked, what was measured in it, what was found and fixed, and
what it is still missing. Read it before walking anything and append to it;
without it every session re-walks what the last one already did. The instrument
is `python3 dashboard/audit_feature_dataflow.py [feature-id]`, which reads each
part's own bus counters per declared wire and keeps "nothing has travelled
here" apart from "nobody has looked here". **29 of 29 walked** as of 2026-09-06
(`market-data-feed`: four defects fixed — the three broker bridges had never
published a single message — and one genuinely missing part,
`broker-quote-bridge`, built. `broker-adapter`: every Upstox REST call in the
project was Cloudflare-blocked on the stdlib User-Agent, so the margin quoter
had failed 1,016 of 1,016 calls and the 5x leverage path had never seen a real
broker margin; all 9 parts now fully carrying. `execution-venue-adapter`:
9 of 11 are the crypto real-money path, correctly off for paper trading, with no
Indian equivalent built yet. `paper-live-trading`: the order chain is idle
because no trade has opened, not broken; `implied-vol-reader` converted off its
crypto stub, and the feed's 2,000-instrument subscription — which was 1,707
options on silver, gold and currency pairs with only 26 of their underlyings
priced — now carries only what the segments trade, 588 of 588 with their
underlying subscribed — **but measured again on 2026-09-06 the live feed reports `subscribed_instruments` **1,974**, not 588, so that narrowing has not held or 588 counted something else; see `docs/feature-audit.md`. `opportunity-scanner`: a fourth checker,
`dashboard/check_declared_inputs.py`, for inputs a part declares and never
reads — six found, five dropped; and the learning chain from a closed trade to a
`bot-maturity` proved end to end on a real replayed trade, which the replay
itself has never exercised).

## TEMPORARY GOAL (first, still active underneath) — 2026-09-05

Three segment bots paper trading on **live** market data by **Monday
2026-09-07** (NSE opens 09:15 IST / 03:45 UTC): **index options**, **stock
options**, then **cash equity intraday, full universe, 5x leverage**. Every part
connected and consistent; a new part is created **only where one is genuinely
necessary**, never cloned per segment.

The user asked for this to be read at the start of every session so that
reminding is not theirs to do. The full statement, in their own words, plus the
one still-open conflict it has with the standing build order — Phase B being
pulled forward — is at the top of `docs/goal.md`. **Index options has never
completed a paper trade live as of 2026-09-05**; Monday's open is its first
real test. All three segments were verified opening and closing a trade
together on the real captured tape that day (index-options 500 tried/343
opened/216 closed, stock-options 254/80/13, cash-equity-intraday's real
top-50 shortlist 50/49/23) — replay, not live, per RL-071; Monday's live open
is still unproven. The other named conflict, the 5x-equity leverage machinery,
was already resolved before this session (`leverage-selector` on since commit
`b0a2d37`; `liquidation-price-tracker`/`paper-liquidation-simulator` correctly
stay off — an intraday equity position is squared off by the broker, not
liquidated at a price, and `intraday-square-off-placer` models that live) —
verified 2026-09-05 by reading the code, `docs/goal.md`'s note updated to say
so.

`/home/anushadudekula71/ajit-segment-bots` is the home directory for this project.
Everything built for it lives inside this directory. Claude Code starts here on
this server by default (see *Startup* below).

## Every part is a transistor — read this before designing anything

**`docs/transistor-rule.md` decides how every feature in this project is built.**
Read it before proposing, designing, or writing any part. It is not a guideline
and no feature is exempt.

The six rules, in short — the full statement and the reasoning are in that file:

| | |
|---|---|
| **T-1** | every feature is the same shape — one part template, no privileged parts |
| **T-2** | control path separate from data path — only the resource governor switches parts, never a feature |
| **T-3** | off means genuinely off — an off part releases its CPU and RAM |
| **T-4** | a part knows nothing about the circuit — it names data, never other parts |
| **T-5** | states are explicit and countable, from `state_vocabulary` |
| **T-6** | grow by adding parts, never by making a part cleverer |

Alongside them, **R-01** (`docs/contracts.md`): edges are computed from
consumes/produces, so a part swaps out cleanly and none can wire itself in.

Checked by `python3 dashboard/check_contracts.py`, and the git pre-commit hook
refuses a commit that breaks any of them. If a design seems to need an exception,
that is the signal to stop and ask — never to grant one.

## This project is not the trading-system project

It is unrelated to `~/trading-system`, `~/capture`, `~/research`, the AJIT MASTER
PLAN, and the `RL-0xx` rulings. Those govern that project, not this one.

Do not import its design decisions, architecture, naming, venv, or code here
unless explicitly asked. If something from there is genuinely wanted, the user
says so — it is never assumed.

The global rules in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` still apply in full: verification
before claiming completion (Rule 0), model selection for subagents (Rule 1),
install rather than skip (Rule 3), the enforcement hooks (Rule 4), research
tooling (Rule 5), interview-spec-plan before creative work (Rule 6), names that
state what the thing does (Rule 7), displays that show measured state (Rule 8),
and everything lives in GitHub (Rule 9).

## Goal

Given by the user; `docs/goal.md` is the source of truth and records what was
actually said. Rulings RL-046..057 (in `~/trading-system/docs/rulings.json`,
injected at session start) refine it.

## Where the project stands — 2026-08-25, every part running

**All 327 parts are on the live spine and 27 of 27 blocks are on.** Phases 5
through 15 of `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-25-phases-5-to-15.md` are started:
closed-trade decoding, prediction, the learning loops, risk and the capital desk,
the bear bot, the tailgater, the execution path, intelligence, hypothesis,
knowledge, backtesting, the LLM blocks, online research, and autonomous last on
purpose.

**Read the coverage number carefully, because it has two halves** (RL-072,
`python3 dashboard/measure_diagram_coverage.py`):

    parts running     327 of 327
    wires carrying   ~4,000 of 4,993   a message has actually travelled
    wires wired up    4,993 of 4,993   both ends are running

The second was the only thing this probe measured until 2026-08-25, and it read
100% within a minute of the last block starting. The bus has always counted every
message a part receives and publishes; those counts ride on health into the
heartbeat table now, and the first figure is the one RL-072 asks for. The rest of
the wires are downstream of a trade the bots have not yet taken, or need a
provider key nobody has installed.

**Two checkers run in the pre-commit hook beside `check_contracts.py`, and both
exist because of defects that could not appear until a producer first ran:**

    python3 dashboard/check_payload_reads.py   a field a producer does not carry
    python3 dashboard/check_part_calls.py      a call an object cannot answer

Between them they found 29 defects on the day they were written, several of them
parts that had never done anything: an exposure limiter that observed every
position at zero, a live-money guard judging three of its four tests against
getattr defaults, a size hint that had never changed a size, a fine-tuned model
that could never be loaded, a proven instruction that could never be compiled.
**A wire with one name and several payload shapes defeats both checks** — that is
what `market-data` was (trades, candles and books), and splitting `candle` out is
what stopped a candle crashing a reader of trades.

**The tape is per stream kind since 2026-08-25, and a second writer is refused by
an flock.** `ccxt-venue-reader` and `venue-trade-stream-reader` appended to one
blob for four hours, each counting its own byte position; 20.3 million records
across 108 files had offsets pointing into the other writer's payloads.
`operate/repair_interleaved_tape.py` recovered 20,282,413 of them, verified
record by record against the venue's own reading of the bytes, and kept the
damaged files as `{day}.interleaved.*`.

The blueprint is `docs/features.json`: 328 parts in 27 blocks, every contract
holding (`python3 dashboard/check_contracts.py`). Build against it; do not
redesign it.

- **Build order (RL-050): futures segment bot first, fully.** Spot and options
  stay skeleton — blocks declared, placeholders, no working code — until futures
  is done.
- **Feature by feature (RL-017).** One part at a time. A part climbs
  `DECLARED → IMPLEMENTED → TESTED → RUNNING` on the part monitor only by the
  probes that measure it — never inferred upward.
- **A design change is a blueprint edit first** (`dashboard/blueprint_edits/`,
  idempotent script + proposal in `docs/proposals/`), checked, committed; code
  follows the registry, never the other way round.
- **Nothing in the runtime spec is open any more** (D-011, 2026-08-20). Stack is
  **standard CPython 3.14.4** — not the free-threaded build, because five packages
  including `ta-lib` ship no `cp314t` wheel and this box has no compiler. Structured
  state is **SQLite** (stdlib, WAL). Settings live at
  **`~/.config/ajit-segment-bots/settings/`** as TOML, one file per scope, closing
  RL-055. Durable numeric state is **file-backed `numpy.memmap`**. Every dependency
  is pinned with a written reason. The numbers behind each are in
  `measurements/2026-08-20-part-runtime/`, and `.venv` is built on 3.14.4.

## How code gets written here — RL-058, and the runtime it produced

**`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-20-part-runtime-design.md` is the implementation
spec.** Read it before writing any part. It decides what a part physically is, where
its on/off switch sits, how scarcity is answered, and where state lives.

The standard, given by the user on 2026-08-20 (RL-058): this is built the way a
professional team builds, not the way a personal project is built. No shortcut code.
No hardcoded values. No placeholders. Real learning in the code. No upper limit on
lines per file. Intent is established by interview, never by assumption (RL-016).

The decisions that followed from that interview:

| | |
|---|---|
| **RL-059** | at most 5 subagents at once, research agents included |
| **RL-060** | parts that judge carry a learned component; pure transport stays deterministic |
| **RL-061** | every number is estimated from data or a named setting with provenance — no numeric literals in decision code |
| **RL-062** | the no-placeholder rule binds futures; spot and options stay honestly empty |
| **RL-063** | tests run on real captured crypto data, never invented fixtures |
| **RL-064** | Python core; Rust for hot paths later and only on measurement |
| **RL-065** | proven libraries for solved problems, own code for the edge, every dependency pinned with a reason |
| **RL-066** | the transistor is hardware governance: a part is a process, the governor owns the switch, scarcity is never answered by a queue |
| **RL-067** | what is built matches the diagrams — a part's real consumes and produces equal what the blueprint declares |
| **RL-068** | build order: substrate, then market-data-feed, then the governor spine, then the futures vertical |
| **RL-069** | the runtime substrate is off-diagram — its own status-board tile, not a cell on the part monitor |
| **RL-071** | the bot trades on live prices as they arrive, exactly as it would with real money; a tape replay is never what a trading decision or a live run's learning is made from |

**Build order matters because no dependency order exists.** 299 of the 321 parts sit
in one feedback cycle, and the transitive inputs of a paper fill are 306 parts. So no
part waits for its upstreams: each is built and tested against recorded real data.
The architecture forces the tape, which is why `market-data-feed` is built first —
history accrues only in real time and cannot be recovered later.

The research behind the runtime, with citations and its own UNVERIFIED sections, is
in `~/research/segment-bots-runtime/` (`ajith4134/trading-system-research`).

## The tape is recording — since 2026-08-22

Phase 1 started capture on the day it became possible. Both venues, the 30
highest-volume symbols on each, trades to disk at
`~/.local/share/ajit-segment-bots/tape/{venue}/{symbol}/{day}.{index,blob}`.

**Since 2026-08-23 the tape is written by the live spine**, not by the capture
script: `operate/run_live_spine.py` starts 47 parts (the feed, the bull bot,
the trading half, and the governor observing without `gate-actuator`), and
`venue-trade-stream-reader` writes the tape. Check it is alive with
`systemctl --user status ajit-spine` and the *Parts alive* tile; restart with
`systemctl --user restart ajit-spine` (SIGTERM flushes the tape and journals).
The spine refuses to start while `start_trade_capture.py` runs, and vice
versa — two writers on one tape make a duplicate indistinguishable from a real
second print.

**Do not stop it without a reason, and never leave it stopped.** History accrues
only in real time: every other part can be built against a tape that exists, and
an hour not captured is gone permanently.

**A crashing part's traceback is in the user journal, not in `ajit-spine`'s.**
Every part is placed in its own systemd scope, so journald files its output under
that scope rather than under the service. `journalctl --user -u ajit-spine` shows
the supervisor's restart counter climbing and nothing else, which cost two hours
of diagnosis on 2026-08-25. The traceback is in:

    journalctl --user --since "-10min" | grep -B 30 Error

    operate/README.md          how to start, stop, and see what it has captured
    operate/ajit-spine.service       the systemd user unit the spine runs under
    operate/keep_capture_running.sh  the capture fallback's shell supervisor

**Since 2026-08-24 the spine survives crashes, logouts and reboots**: it runs as
the systemd user unit `ajit-spine` (Restart=always, lingering already enabled),
installed after the 04:35 reboot that morning cost eleven hours of live
learning — the capture units came back at boot and the hand-started spine did
not. The `ajit-capture@` units stay installed but *disabled* as the fallback;
enable one side only, never both.

`operate/` is not parts. It stands in for `stream-budget-planner` and the
governor until those exist, and should be deleted when they do.

## Startup

**Since 2026-09-20 the `claude` shell function starts in `~/youtube-automation`,
not here** (operator's instruction). To work in this project:

    CLAUDE_START_DIR=~/ajit-segment-bots claude

`~/.bash_aliases` defines the function; `CLAUDE_START_DIR` sets the directory
(default `~/youtube-automation`). To run in the current directory for one
invocation:

    CLAUDE_KEEP_CWD=1 claude

The function lives in `~/.bash_aliases` rather than `~/.bashrc` because the
`protect-files.sh` PreToolUse hook guards shell profiles, and `~/.bashrc`
already sources that file. It is a shell function rather than a wrapper script
in `~/.local/bin` because Claude Code auto-updates rewrite the symlink there,
which would silently revert the behaviour.

## Rebuilding every board

    dashboard/rebuild_all_boards.sh

One command, all five boards, in dependency order. It exists because they went
stale and nobody noticed: the part monitor was current and the other three were
two days old, showing a project with nothing built while five parts were built
and a million records were on the tape. **A stale board is worse than no board —
it is convincing.** The script prints the five Artifact URLs to re-publish to;
publishing is not scripted, because those URLs live outside this repository and a
script that pretended to publish would be the same failure one layer along.

## Status board

    python3 dashboard/build_status_board.py

Regenerates `dashboard/status-board.html` from probes that actually run. Every
tile traces to one. Nothing on it is hand-written, and anything unprobed renders
as `NOT MEASURED` — never as healthy. Re-publish that file to the same Artifact
URL to update the shared link.

## Part monitor

    python3 dashboard/build_part_monitor.py

Regenerates `dashboard/part-monitor.html`: every part in the blueprint as a cell,
coloured by how far it is actually built. Four rungs, each a probe that runs —
`DECLARED` (in the blueprint, contract intact, no code), `IMPLEMENTED` (a source
file named for the part exists), `TESTED` (a test file names it), `RUNNING` (it
reports a heartbeat). `FAILING` is wired to the contract checker, so a part it
names goes red.

Where it stands on 2026-08-23: 324 parts `TESTED`, 47 of them `RUNNING` on the
live spine. `TESTED` means a source file and a test file exist, nothing more;
**277 parts carry no `start_part` and cannot be launched at all.** `RUNNING` is
read from the table `heartbeat-collector` writes at `heartbeat_table_path` —
the same file the trade board's *Parts alive* tile reads — and a table older
than `heartbeat_silent_after_seconds` proves nothing about any part. Cells
climb as code lands and as parts run — nothing is ever inferred upward, and a
failing part never counts as progress.

## Part board (the live one)

    python3 dashboard/part_health_api.py          # serves /api/board + the built frontend
    cd dashboard/web && npm install && npm run build
    python3 dashboard/build_board_snapshot.py     # freezes it into dashboard/board.html
    dashboard/web/verify_board_renders.sh         # proves the page actually draws

A React board over the same probes as the part monitor: 22 blocks, 78 parts, each
cell clickable for the proof that produced its rung. Two builds from one source —
`dist/` polls the API and says `LIVE · polling`, `board.html` inlines one measured
payload and says `SNAPSHOT · frozen`. The mode travels inside the payload, so a
frozen page can never pass itself off as live.

The snapshot exists because only port 22 listens on this server: the live board
cannot reach the user, so the page is published instead.

Never trust a green build for this. `verify_board_renders.sh` mounts the page in
Chromium and fails on any console error. Chromium needs libraries and fonts this
server does not have; both are installed in `~/.local/pwdeps` and the script
refuses to run without them. Missing fonts do not error — they paint every glyph
invisible while every DOM assertion still passes, which is exactly the failure a
screenshot catches and an assertion does not.

## Trade board

    python3 dashboard/build_trade_board.py

Regenerates `dashboard/trade-board.html`: every trade the system has recorded,
and the probes that say whether it can make another one. Each tile reads a file
on this machine — the journal the settings name, the live spine's supervisor log
joined to `/proc`, the tape's last write, the segment's money mode, and the
conviction model's own checkpoint.

Two tables. **Open positions** carries the capital in USDT that went into each
one (2026-08-23), the entry, the price now with its age, the stop, the peak and
the worst it went through. **Closed trades** carries entry, exit, capital in, how
long it was held, peak, worst, fees and net. An exit fill reduces a position
rather than adding to it, so a position sold back reads as closed.

The states it must be able to reach, because they are the true ones:
`NOTHING YET` when no trade has opened on a live run and when nothing has closed
yet, `NOT BUILT` for tamper evidence (the journal starts a new chain every time a
recorder starts), and `NOT MEASURED` when the bull bot has never checkpointed —
which is a different fact from a checkpoint saying zero, and neither is healthy.

**Learning progress is measured, since 2026-08-23.** The number on the board is
read from `bull-conviction-model`'s own checkpoint under `learned_state_root`,
which is the same file the model restores from — not a second count kept for the
board, which would be free to disagree with the one the bot acts on.

**A journal entry recorded before the trading half was first started live is
marked as a test's.** The integration test runs the same fourteen parts, and the
boundary is read from the supervisor log rather than guessed.

## The live board — a real URL, since 2026-08-25

    systemctl --user status ajit-board          # API + frontend, loopback only
    systemctl --user status ajit-board-tunnel   # the public URL
    operate/read_board_url.sh                   # what that URL is right now

The part board served live instead of published, over a cloudflared quick
tunnel that dials *out* — no inbound port, port 22 stays the only thing
listening. **The URL changes on every restart**, so it is read from the tunnel's
journal rather than remembered.

**Four views.** *What it is doing* — every part's live standing counters with a
**measured** rate. *Trading* — open positions from the checkpoint
`position-close-detector` restores from, marked against the tape per held symbol,
and closed trades from a bounded tail of the position journal (net, not gross: a
board showing gross calls a fee-eaten loser a winner). *Server load* — CPU,
memory, load and disk from `/proc` and `statvfs`, plus what each running part
costs, joined from the spine's supervisor log to `/proc/<pid>`. *How far built* —
the rung ladder.

Two decisions on that last one worth not undoing: busy **excludes iowait**,
because counting it reports 100% CPU on a machine asleep waiting for a disk; and
memory is total minus **MemAvailable**, not MemFree, because free memory on a busy
Linux box is near zero by design.

`build_trade_board.py` still streams both journals end to end and still takes ten
minutes. That is right for a page built once and wrong for a view meant to be
refreshed, which is why `/api/trades` reads two small things instead — and says
in the panel that its rows are the recent ones, never all of them.

The live rate is the same idea throughout:
taken as a delta between two heartbeat tables the serving process actually
observed. Three-valued on purpose — `WORKING` is a counter that moved, `IDLE` is
every counter holding still (a finding, not a fault), `NOT MEASURED` is no rate
taken yet, because calling that idle would assert a measurement nobody made.

`/api/board` is the expensive shape (327 rungs, measured off the filesystem) and
is polled slowly; `/api/activity` is one small file and is polled fast. They fail
independently: when activity dies the shape stays on screen and only the live
column goes dark.

Never trust a green `npm run build`. `dashboard/web/verify_live_board_renders.sh`
mounts the page in Chromium, waits for a *second* poll so a rate exists, opens a
block, opens a part, and fails on any console error. It is separate from
`verify_board_renders.sh`, which waits for `networkidle` — that never fires on a
page that polls forever.

## The governor can switch a part back on — since 2026-08-26

**Until this date nothing the governor switched off ever came back.** Over eight
unattended hours it wrote 152 switch-records, every one an off and every one
`hog-under-contention`, with `switched_on` 0 across 30,150 plans. The 42 parts it
left off included `order-book-reader`, `venue-quote-stream-reader` and
`tick-size-resolver`, and no order was placed in those eight hours. The coverage
probe read 285 of 327 running, down from 327 the evening before, and nothing
reported a fault: every one of those offs was a decision the governor was
entitled to make. Only the return was missing.

`switching-planner` now remembers what it shed and re-reads the reason on every
plan. What it re-reads is the **machine-level** condition, because the
part-level one is unobservable while the part is off — an off part publishes no
usage, so no hog report can name it and no forecast can call it the fastest
grower. The evidence is symmetric on purpose: a part is shed on a hog report and
comes back when the reports stop, which is what `hog-detector` publishing only
under contention already means.

Its standing answers "why is that part still off" without reading the code:

    switched_off / switched_on / restored     what it decided, and what came back
    off_until_the_pressure_clears             shed and waiting for the condition
    sheds_still_stopping / sheds_confirmed_gone   which of those are really gone
    conservation_plan_names / hog_reports_read     what the last plan actually saw
    hogs_deferred                             hogs one measurement did not justify

**A level with no age bound is the trap this project keeps falling into.**
`LatestByKey` holds a key's last value forever unless `maximum_age_seconds` is
set, and four parts read `part-resource-usage` without it. The planner's "what is
running is what is reporting its own usage" therefore included **every part the
governor had ever switched off** — 214 of them at 05:11 on 2026-08-26 — so no
shed part could ever be observed gone, and `off-state-verifier` had recorded 167
faults with **0 verified releases** because the reading it checks for a released
part never expired. With `part_usage_reading_maximum_age_seconds` bounding all
four: 0 faults, 26 verified. The same shape cost `position-sizer` a fifty-six
minute stale price on 2026-08-23; the bound exists, it is opt-in, and the
question to ask of every `LatestByKey` is what makes its keys go away.

**The control path is never shed.** The governor had switched off its own
`memory-pressure-forecaster`, `duty-cycle-planner` and `part-restart-budgeter`
for hogging, then went on planning against the last levels those three managed to
publish. `never_switched_off_priority_ceiling` (27) covers the fourteen
resource-governor parts and `control-recorder`, ranked in `part-priority.toml`;
unlike `reservation_priority_ceiling` (10) it reserves no capacity, it only
refuses to shed.

Two decisions inside the planner worth not undoing:

- **One hog per measurement.** Fair share is an equal slice among the parts
  running, so at 327 parts everything doing real work is over three times it the
  moment the machine is contended: one reading named sixteen parts and
  `gate-actuator` flipped all sixteen, two seconds apart, from that one reading.
  The worst hog is shed and the next decision is made against a fresh sweep.
- **An ask is not repeated until it could have been answered.** A part takes a
  second or two to start and another sweep to be metered; re-asking sooner
  produced 17 `PartAlreadyRunning` refusals, which is the 2026-08-24 defect in a
  new place.

## A level is not an event, on the write side too — since 2026-08-26

`runtime/input_assembly.py` has always stated the difference on the **read** side:
a level is true until it changes, an event happened once. There was no shape for
it on the **write** side, and 23 parts ended their tick with an unconditional
`publish(thing.read_all())`. Every part publishes health once a second, so a part
consuming `part-health` wakes 327 times a second — and each of those wakes
republished a level nobody had changed.

    failing-part-detector    26,575 msg/s published from    283 received
    part-restart-budgeter    17,106 msg/s published from  6,963 received
    order-flow-state-encoder 10,353 msg/s published from    773 received
    spine total              89,747 msg/s, load 28.7 on twelve cores

Seven parts read as silent because they could not get the CPU to send the
heartbeat that would have proved them alive — and the detector was firing on
exactly that, so the storm fed itself.

`runtime/level_publishing.py` is the missing half. Three shapes, and picking the
wrong one is the mistake to avoid:

| | |
|---|---|
| `LevelPublisher` | publish when the value changed, or when the refresh interval is due |
| `LevelPublisherByKey` | the same per subject, so one part changing does not restate the other 326 |
| `PacedPublisher` | for a level whose every field really does move — a heartbeat table of climbing counters. A rate, not a change check |

**`identity_of` is not optional in practice.** Nearly every payload here carries
`measured_at_ns` or `observed_at_ns`, stamped when the part looked — 17 and 14 of
them respectively. Compared whole, two statements of one unchanged level are
never equal, so nothing is skipped and **the skip counter reads zero while the
fix appears to be in**. That is not hypothetical: it is what the first version of
this did to `PartFault` and `ExcursionProfile`. `without_observation_time` drops
that fixed list of names and nothing else — `next_settlement_at_ns` is content,
not noticing, and a rule over `*_at_ns` would have stopped publishing it.

**Pace the work, not just the send, when building the answer is the expensive
half.** `heartbeat-collector` cost 73% of a core rebuilding a 327-row table
(4.2 ms), rendering it (1.3 ms) and writing 209 KB of JSON (4.2 ms) seventeen
times a second; `correlation-cluster-mapper` cost 76% correlating 2,211 pairs on
every tick. Both guard the build with `is_due()`, not only the publish.

**A resend is not loss repair — it is usually the cause of the loss.**
`order-flow-state-encoder` republished a 120-state window per trade batch to
convey one new second, and `flow-entropy-meter` — which keeps its own window,
keyed by second — had dropped **158,902** of them. Sending only what is new
conveys strictly more.

    after:  spine 36,974 msg/s, load 12.5, 327 of 327 running, 0 silent

## A control loop never switches off its own instrument — since 2026-08-26

The governor learned this about itself earlier the same day. The survival tier
had not.

`survival-tier-monitor` reports `SHUTDOWN` whenever nothing has been measured, and
that is correct — assuming runway you have not measured is how a system finds out
it is broke by stopping. `conservation-planner` acted on it and stopped 182 parts
per plan. Among them were `subscription-quota-watch` and `paid-spend-ledger`, the
**only** producers of `llm-quota-state` and `llm-spend-state` — the two readings
the tier is computed from. Their processes were released (T-3), so nothing could
ever measure again and the tier stayed `SHUTDOWN` permanently:

    145 of 327 parts alive, every conservation block dark, 9 GB of 29 GB used,
    and no fault reported anywhere -- every one of those stops was a decision the
    planner was entitled to make. Only the measuring was gone.

`never_switched_off_priority_ceiling` is **29** now and both sensors are ranked
inside it. Deliberately not `conservation_protected_parts`: naming a part there
refuses the **whole plan**, which would disable conservation outright. The ceiling
refuses to shed without refusing the plan.

Ask of any new control loop: *what does it measure itself with, and can it switch
that off?*

**A crash can be invisible until a restart.** The previous session added an
abstract `read_premiums` to `VenueAdapter` and implemented it for Binance only, so
`BybitLinearAdapter` could not be constructed and every part loading a venue
adapter crash-looped. Nothing showed it for hours, because the running spine held
the pre-change code in memory. **After changing anything a live part imports,
restart the spine and read the journal — a green test suite does not prove the
thing that is running can still start.**

## What this box actually holds

**All 327 parts on measured a load average of 30.6 one minute after start**, on
twelve cores. The phase 5-15 plan sized 327 parts at 11.4 cores by extrapolating
from 59 running; the extrapolation was not wrong about cores — steady state is
about 8.6 across 319 parts — but load is not cores, and start-up is where it
bites. `measurements/2026-08-26-what-fits-on-this-box/sample_what_fits.py`
samples the machine every minute and prints what each part costs, read from its
own cgroup.

RL-072's target is every part running and every wire carrying. That target and
this machine are not obviously compatible, and the honest reading of a governor
that sheds under contention is that **the board should show parts off with the
reason, not a coverage number that quietly excludes them.**

## Position state survives a restart — since 2026-08-25

`position-close-detector` and `cost-basis-tracker` checkpoint their lot books to
`position_state_root` on every fill, and restore on start.

Before this they held them in memory alone. The spine had started 46 times, 855
positions had been opened and 115 round trips closed: **every start forgot every
open position**, and a position whose lots are forgotten can never reach flat,
never emits a `closed-trade`, and can never be scored. 86% of everything ever
opened was unaccounted for and nothing reported it as a fault.

Quantities are stored as strings, and `runtime/trading_types.exact_quantity` is
the door they come through. `Decimal(str(x))`, never `Decimal(x)` — the latter
carries the float's error in. `LotBook.is_flat` is `== 0` exactly, so there is no
tolerance to tune and no numeric literal to justify under RL-061.

`cointegration-pair-finder` keeps its price series and its verdicts too, under
`pair_state_checkpoint_interval` observations rather than every fill — a lot book
changes 40 times an hour and losing one costs a round trip, while a price series
changes hundreds of times a second and losing a second of it costs nothing.
Measured across a restart: 100 series and 214 verdicts back, 263 cointegrated
pairs where a cold start is at zero.

Each window carries its own last observation time, so the gap across a restart is
**measured** rather than assumed continuous — without it the first price after an
outage sits beside the last one before it and reads as an instant move, which is
exactly the shape a detector fires on. A window restored under a different length
or gap bound is refused rather than reinterpreted.

**Still memory-only:** `spread-reversion-detector`'s per-pair spread history, and
the bull feature builder's own windows. After a restart the arbiter stands aside
until conviction is back, which is what actually delays the first trade — the
scanner is no longer the bottleneck it was.

## Wiring explorer

    python3 dashboard/build_wiring_explorer.py
    dashboard/web/verify_wiring_renders.sh      # proves the page draws, clicks all three views

Regenerates `dashboard/wiring-explorer.html`: every connection between parts, as
the contract checker sees it. The block-level mermaid planes on the status board
stay the right picture of the *story*; at 25 blocks and 1 363 part-to-part wires
a node-link drawing is a hairball, so this page is the tool for *checking*:

- **Matrix** — 25 × 25 blocks, a cell counts the data types flowing row → column.
  Click a cell for the exact part pairs. Peer blocks (bull, bear, tailgater)
  must stay empty against each other — a filled cell there paints red (R-03).
- **Part focus** — one part in the centre, what feeds it left, what it feeds
  right, wires labelled by data type. Click any part to recentre.
- **Data type** — who writes it, who reads it.

The checker's verdict and the measurement time are stamped in the header.
